## Operational Characteristics

### Agentic Execution Model
```
FOR each pipeline_phase:
    result = execute_with_agentic_intelligence(phase)
    IF result.failed:
        # ðŸ¤– ALGORITHMIC AGENT: Fast classification
        complexity = classify_issue_complexity(result)
        
        IF complexity == "simple":
            result = apply_algorithmic_recovery(result)
        ELIF complexity == "complex":
            # ðŸ§  LLM AGENT: Deep analysis
            llm_analysis = analyze_with_llm(result)
            result = apply_llm_guided_recovery(result, llm_analysis)
        ELIF complexity == "critical":
            escalate_with_intelligent_context(result)
        END IF
    END IF
END FOR
```

Target Platform: Java Enterprise

Recommend:
1. Modern equivalent alternatives
2. Migration strategies and approaches
3. Implementation complexity assessment
4. Priority order for remediation
5. Estimated effort and timeline"
```

#### 3. Intelligent JIRA Ticket Creation
```
PROMPT TEMPLATE:
"Create a comprehensive JIRA ticket for this pipeline issue:

Issue Analysis: {llm_analysis}

#### Autonomous Decision-Making
```
FUNCTION make_agentic_decision(issue, context, history):
    # Fast algorithmic assessment
    quick_analysis = algorithmic_agent.analyze(issue)
    
    IF quick_analysis.confidence > 0.8:
        RETURN quick_analysis.recommended_action
    
    # Deep LLM analysis for complex scenarios
    llm_analysis = llm_agent.analyze(issue, context, history)
    
    # Combine insights for optimal decision
    final_decision = synthesize_insights(quick_analysis, llm_analysis)
    
    # Learn from outcome for future decisions
    update_knowledge_base(issue, final_decision, outcome)
    
    RETURN final_decision
```

#### Context-Aware Processing
- **Execution History**: Learn from previous successes and failures
- **Environmental Factors**: System load, time of day, resource availability
