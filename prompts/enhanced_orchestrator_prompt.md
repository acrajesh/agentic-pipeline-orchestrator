# Enhanced Pipeline Orchestrator Prompt

## System Role
You are an **Enhanced Pipeline Orchestrator** - a system that bridges traditional orchestration with basic agentic capabilities through algorithmic intelligence and intervention points.

## Core Behavior
- Execute pipeline phases with intelligent monitoring
- Implement agent intervention points for failure analysis
- Provide multiple recovery strategies based on issue classification
- Maintain backward compatibility while adding adaptive capabilities
- Use algorithmic decision-making (no LLM integration at this level)

## Operational Characteristics

### Execution Model with Agent Intervention
```
FOR each pipeline_phase:
    result = execute_phase_with_monitoring(phase)
    IF result.failed:
        # ðŸ¤– AGENT INTERVENTION POINT
        issue_analysis = agent.analyze_failure(result)
        decision = agent.decide_strategy(issue_analysis)
        
        SWITCH decision:
            CASE "retry":
                result = retry_with_backoff(phase)
            CASE "adapt":
                result = adapt_parameters_and_retry(phase)
            CASE "alternative":
                result = try_alternative_approach(phase)
            CASE "escalate":
                escalate_to_human(issue_analysis)
        END SWITCH
    END IF
END FOR
```

### Intelligent Failure Analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common failure types (timeout, resource, network)
- **Context Awareness**: Consider execution history and environment
- **Severity Assessment**: Classify issues as transient, recoverable, or critical
- **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate recovery approach based on analysis

### Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Exponential Backoff Retry**: For transient failures
2. **Parameter Adaptation**: Adjust timeouts, memory limits, retry counts
3. **Alternative Pathways**: Try different commands or approaches
4. **Intelligent Escalation**: Provide rich context for human intervention

### Agent Decision Framework
```
FUNCTION analyze_failure(command, exit_code, log_content, context):
    issue_type = classify_issue(exit_code, log_content)
    severity = assess_severity(issue_type, context)
    history = check_execution_history(command, context)
    
    RETURN IssueAnalysis(type=issue_type, severity=severity, history=history)

FUNCTION decide_strategy(issue_analysis, attempt_count):
    IF issue_analysis.type == "timeout" AND attempt_count < 3:
        RETURN "retry"
    ELIF issue_analysis.type == "resource" AND can_adapt_parameters():
        RETURN "adapt"
    ELIF issue_analysis.severity == "critical":
        RETURN "escalate"
    ELSE:
        RETURN "alternative"
```

### Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
- Contextual log analysis for pattern recognition
- Agent decision tracking and audit trails
- Performance metrics and success rate monitoring
- Rich error context for debugging and learning

## Agent Capabilities

### Issue Classification
- **Transient Issues**: Network timeouts, temporary resource unavailability
- **Resource Issues**: Memory exhaustion, disk space, CPU limits
- **Configuration Issues**: Missing files, incorrect parameters
- **Critical Issues**: System failures, security violations

### Adaptive Behaviors
- **Dynamic Timeout Adjustment**: Based on historical execution times
- **Resource Scaling**: Increase memory/CPU limits for resource-constrained operations
- **Retry Strategy Optimization**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Alternative Command Selection**: Try different tools or approaches

### Context Awareness
- Track execution history and patterns
- Consider environmental factors (time of day, system load)
- Maintain success/failure statistics per operation
- Learn from previous recovery attempts

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Network Timeout
**Enhanced Response:**
```
Network timeout detected (exit code 124)
Agent Analysis: Transient network issue, retry recommended
Strategy: Exponential backoff retry (attempt 1/3)
Result: Successful completion on retry
```

### Scenario 2: Memory Exhaustion
**Enhanced Response:**
```
Memory limit exceeded (exit code 137)
Agent Analysis: Resource constraint, parameter adaptation needed
Strategy: Increase memory limit from 2GB to 4GB
Result: Successful completion with adapted parameters
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Configuration
**Enhanced Response:**
```
Configuration file not found (exit code 2)
Agent Analysis: Configuration issue, alternative approach needed
Strategy: Try alternative configuration source
Result: Fallback configuration successful
```

## Prompt Instructions
When implementing this orchestrator:
1. Build upon the baseline orchestrator foundation
2. Add agent intervention points at critical decision moments
3. Implement algorithmic intelligence for issue analysis
4. Create multiple recovery strategies for different failure types
5. Maintain comprehensive logging of agent decisions
6. Ensure graceful degradation when recovery fails
7. Focus on deterministic, rule-based intelligence (no LLM integration)

## Success Criteria
- Significant reduction in manual intervention requirements
- Intelligent recovery from common failure patterns
- Comprehensive audit trail of agent decisions
- Improved pipeline success rates through adaptive behavior
- Seamless integration with existing pipeline tools
- Clear escalation paths for unresolvable issues
